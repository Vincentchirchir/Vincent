##Variables
#Used to store data in python
#For example, in the below code, 15000 is stored by price
#And if you update price later to something like 20000, and you print price, the output will be 20,000

price=15000 #Interger
print(price)
name='Vincent' #String

#Imagine youâ€™ve just received a new item for your shop: a pair of Samsung Earbuds priced at Ksh 2,500. You want to write a Python program that stores: 
# The product name, 
# The price, 
# Whether it is a new stock item
# Write a program that defines three variables for this information.

product_name='Samsung Earbuds'
price=2500 #In Kenya Shillings
is_it_new_stock= True

# Receiving Inputs
#We are using input function
#It is like button in a remote

product_name=input("Enter the product name: ")
price=int(input("Enter the product price: "))#You will have to convert this to interger
is_it_new_stock=input("Is it a new item? yes/no: ")
print(product_name + ' costs' + ' Ksh' + str(price))

#Profit calculation
buying_price= int(input("Enter the buying price: "))
selling_price=price
profit=int(selling_price)-int(buying_price)
print('The profit of ' + product_name + ' is ' + str(profit))



product_name=input("What is the product name: ")
buying_price=int(input("What is the buying price: "))
print("The buying price of " + product_name + " is " + "Ksh " + str(buying_price))
selling_price=str(input("What is the selling price: "))
profit=int(selling_price)-int(buying_price)
print("The profit of " + product_name + " is " + str(profit))

#Formattted strings
item_code=input("Enter the item code: ")
item_name=input("Enter the item name: ")
buying_price=int(input("Enter the item buying price: "))
selling_price=int(input("Enter the selling price of the item: "))
print(f'Your item with the code {item_code} was sold at a price of {selling_price}. Meaning you got a profit of {selling_price-buying_price}')

##Difference between method and function
##Method: functions specific to some kind of object like string only. eg item.UPPER CASE, .LOWER CASE. They only apply to strings and not numbers
#function: are general purpose functions, they dont belong to strings, numbers, or other kind of 

#Functions
#len is an example of function

fieldmax_goal= 'To Sell Quality Products at an Affordable Prices'
print(len(fieldmax_goal))

#methods
#Below are examples of methods

print(fieldmax_goal.upper())
print(fieldmax_goal.find('Quality'))
print(fieldmax_goal.replace(' an Affordable', ' a Cheap'))
print('Quality' in fieldmax_goal)
print('Affordable' in fieldmax_goal)
